# DMN

Includes codes for Dynamic Memory Networks, a variant of neural networks incorporating an attention mechanism to produce episodic memory. The aim of this project is to create a bot version of APJ Abdul Kalam, so that coming generation can know about him in an interactive manner. This bot should be able to answer questions written in natural language by a user and give factual answers by understanding the question.

The code in DMN_orig.py is that of a fully supervised DMN as given in the research paper (still requires a few small modifications)  : 
" http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.07285v5.pdf "

The results obtained are as follows : 

Task 1 : 100 %

Task 2 : 85 %

Task 3 : 69 %

Task 4 : 100 %

Task 5 : 97.9 %

Task 6 : 100 %

Task 7 : 90 %

Task 8 : 95.6 %

Task 9 : 100 %

Task 10 : 93.8 %

Task 11 : 100 %

Task 12 : 100 %

Task 13 : 100 %

Task 14 : 100 %

Task 15 : 100 %

Task 16 : 100 %

Task 17 : 50 %

Task 18 : 96.5 %

Task 19 : 28.6 %

Task 10 : 100 %

As of now, regularization has not been used for training but shall be incorporated in future to improve results. Also the number of episodes produced (analogous to memory hops in MemNN) have been kept contant at 3 except for tasks 7,8 where it is kept at 7. The future codes should be able to produce the required no. of episodes automatically. 

My codes don't give expected values for tasks - 2, 3, 7, 8.  
Tasks 17 and 19 are still open problems.

(Versions of DMN other than DMN_orig.py were made while trying to make the original version as given in the paper only to carry out a few tests and gain insights. They have a lot of discrepancies and are in no way any improvements)
 
Necessary modifications in codes, advises and reasons for the poor performance in the above 6 tasks are more than welcome.
