# DMN

Includes codes for Dynamic Memory Networks, a variant of neural networks incorporating episodic memory. The aim of this project is to create a bot version of APJ Abdul Kalam, so that coming generation can know about him in an interactive manner. This bot should be able to answer questions written in natural language by a user and give factual answers by understanding the question.
The model and results of DMN_orig.py is by far closest to the paper.
The other DMN codes were written while developing the final model and have a few errors. DMN_orig.py still requires small modifications such as adding regularization among a few. It gives a 100% accuracy on the first set of bAbI task after 4 epochs. A detailed list of results for various parameter settings shall be updated soon.
